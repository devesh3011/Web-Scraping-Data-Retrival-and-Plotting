# Data-Retreival, Plotting and Web-Scraping
A script to download the Fortune top 10 E.U corporations by revenue (2016) from Wikipedia and perform operations to make sense and retrieve information from the data.

Task1:
Data retrieval and plotting.
1. Write a script to download the Fortune top 10 E.U corporations by revenue (2016) table
under the “Companies” section.
URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union
2. Once the required table has been extracted calculate the following:
 Revenue ($mn) per Employee
 Profit ($mn) per Employee
 Profit margins (Profit / Revenue) (in %)
 Revenue share of the company to the total revenues of the top 10 E.U. corporations
(2016).
3. Plot a bar chart with the company that has the best profit margin in each
“Industry”. That is, each industry will have a bar labelled with the company that has the
best profit margin in that industry.
Make the bar chart as informative as you can by adding legends, labels, titles, units, etc.
Save the bar chart as a .png file with good resolution in the same directory as your code
file.
4. Write out the dataframe with the table that you extracted and add the 4 columns
calculated above to a csv file in the same directory as your code file.

Task2:
Retrieve the dataset present behind the graphs in the following link in an excel sheet. You’re
free to use any kind of approach.
