Step-1
 I inspected the webpage provided: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/04/03/climate/us-fuel-economy.html
by clicking right anywhere on the page and selecting inspect element.

Step-2:
Switch to Network tab and reloaded the page. The Network view in the inspector starts to fill up with information.
The Network view shows a list of every file that is loaded by the browser when the page is being accessed.

Step-3:
Switch to XHR tab to look through data sources. This actually stands for XML HTTP Request.

Step-4:
Look for a .csv file or JSON objects. This is because mostly graphs are plotted directly from .csv files or some JSON object fetches content from the server. 

Step-5: 
Right click on the sources you feel could be possible and open in new tab.
Check if it is the data source youâ€™re looking for.

In my case I found the dataset in a csv file: cafe-combined.csv
